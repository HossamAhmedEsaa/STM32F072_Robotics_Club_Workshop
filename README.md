# STM32F072_Robotics_Club_Workshop
A small workshop I created for the robotics club of the University of Coimbra, Portugal.


  This repository holds the codes used in a STM32F0 workshop done in the robotics club of the University of Coimbra, Portugal.
  This is specific to the STM32F072 Nucleo board, with IAR Workbench IDE and using the standard peripheral library F0 package.
